# Newsweb Coding Exercise

This coding exercise is a bare-bones Todo application built with React and TypeScript. The exercise is designed to allow creativity in any area you wish, whether that's writing tests, improving types, adding styles, accessibility, clean code or just adding features. You may choose whatever you see fit to improve the application.

**There's only one requirement:** add a counter that displays how many items are left todo.

Any improvements or changes you make should be documented thoroughly in `NOTES.md`. Be sure to note your reasoning and thoughts as this is more important than the changes.

## Available Commands

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors reported in the console.

### `npm test`

Run the test suite. Note there is only one test available as an example.
