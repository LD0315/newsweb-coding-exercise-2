# Newsweb Coding Exercise

This coding exercise is a bare-bones Todo application built with React and TypeScript. The exercise is designed to allow creativity in any area you wish, whether that's writing tests, improving types, adding styles, accessibility, clean code or just adding features. You may choose whatever you see fit to improve the application.

## Requirements:

1. Add a counter that displays how many items are remaining todo.
2. Improve the application and code base.

Any improvements or changes you make should be documented thoroughly in `NOTES.md`. Be sure to note your reasoning and thoughts as this is more important than the changes.

1. Visit https://github.com/new/import with your GH account
2. Paste `https://github.com/abcnews/newsweb-coding-exercise-2.git` into the clone URL field
3. Enter the repo name `newsweb-coding-exercise-2`
4. Make sure the repo is set to **Private**
5. Add the reviewers as collaborators to the new repo under Settings > Manage Access
